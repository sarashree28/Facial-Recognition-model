# Facial-Recognition-model
The model uses Siamese Neural Networks. We have 3 different files, positive, negative and anchor. Anchor file is where we keep the test images. The positive file consists of all the images similar to ones in the anchor file. The negative, on the other hand, consists of all the images which does not match to the ones present on the anchor.
